# Unsupervised-Learning

Machine Learning model trained to play Tic Tac Toe by generating its own data by playing against itself

1. Build Tic Tac Toe game from scratch

2. Build Q-Learning ML Agent 

3. Train Q-Learning Agent to play Tic Tac Toe game by having it play against itself

4. Create application with two modes:
  a. human: play against Q-Learning Agent
  b. watch: watch Q-Learning Agent play against itself
